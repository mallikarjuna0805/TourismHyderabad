        <h1><br>HYDERABAD</h1>
        <p1>Hyderabad is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Telangana.
              It occupies 650 km2 (250 sq mi) on the Deccan Plateau along the banks of
               the Musi River, in the northern part of Southern India. With an average 
               altitude of 542 m (1,778 ft), much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain
                around artificial lakes, including the Hussain Sagar lake, predating the city's
                 founding, in the north of the city centre. According to the 2011 Census of India,
                  Hyderabad is the fourth-most populous city in India with a population of 6.9 million
                   residents within the city limits, and has a population of 9.7 million residents
                    in the metropolitan region, making it the sixth-most populous metropolitan area
                     in India. With an output of US$74 billion, Hyderabad has the fifth-largest urban
                      economy in India.<br><br>
            Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah established Hyderabad in 1591 to extend the capital beyond
             the fortified Golconda. In 1687, the city was annexed by the Mughals. In 1724, Mughal
              Viceroy Nizam Asaf Jah I declared his sovereignty and founded the Asaf Jahi dynasty,
               also known as the Nizams. Hyderabad served as the imperial capital of the Asaf Jahis
                from 1769 to 1948. As capital of the princely state of Hyderabad, the city housed the
                 British Residency and cantonment until Indian independence in 1947. Hyderabad was annexed
                  by the Indian Union in 1948 and continued as a capital of Hyderabad State (1948â€“56). After
                   the introduction of the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, Hyderabad was made the capital
                    of the newly formed Andhra Pradesh. In 2014, Andhra Pradesh was bifurcated to form Telangana
                     and Hyderabad became the joint capital of the two states with a transitional arrangement scheduled
                      to end in 2024. Since 1956, the city has housed the winter office of the President of India.<br><br>
            Relics of the Qutb Shahi and the Nizam rules remain visible today; the Charminar has come to symbolise the city.
             By the end of the early modern era, the Mughal Empire declined in the Deccan and the Nizam's patronage had
              attracted men of letters from various parts of the world. A distinctive culture arose from the amalgamation
               of local and migrated artisans. Painting, handicraft, jewellery, literature, dialect and clothing are prominent
                still today. Through its cuisine, the city is listed as a UNESCO creative city of gastronomy. The Telugu film
                 industry based in the city was the country's second-largest producer of motion pictures as of 2012.
            Until the 19th century Hyderabad was known for the pearl industry and was nicknamed the "City of Pearls", and was
             the only Golconda Diamonds trading centre in the world. Many of the city's historical and traditional bazaars remain
              open. Hyderabad's central location between the Deccan Plateau and the Western Ghats, and industrialisation throughout
               the 20th century attracted major Indian research, manufacturing, educational and financial institutions. Since the 1990s,
                the city has emerged as an Indian hub of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. The formation of special economic zones and
                 HITEC City dedicated to information technology has encouraged leading multinationals to set up operations in Hyderabad.
