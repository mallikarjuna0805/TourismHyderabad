        <h1><br>SALAR JUNG MUSEUM</h1>
        <p1>At the banks of Musi River, Salar Jung Museum is located.
             With an impressive collection of 43000 art objects, 9000
              manuscripts and 47000 printed books, it is considered to
               be one of the biggest one-man collections of the world.

            This museum has 38 galleries with 20 galleries in 1st floor
             while the rest 18 galleries on the 2nd floor. In 1951, it was 
             opened to public while in 1968 it was shifted to its current building.
            
            The artifacts of the museums are primarily collected by Mir
             Yousuf Ali Khan (Salar Jung III) and Nawab Turab Ali Khan
              (Salar Jung I) along with a few of his descendants.
