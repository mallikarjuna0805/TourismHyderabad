        <h1><br>PURANI HAVELI</h1>
        <p1>In 16th century, it was used as the residential quarter of Mir Momen,
             the Peshwa of Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah. However, later in 18th century,
              it was acquired and then renovated by Nizam III. It was then passed on
               to his son Sikandar Jah, who, although moved to the Khilaurat complex,
                which gave it the name of Purani Haveli.

            Haveli presents a beautiful amalgamation of traditional Indian courtyards
             and 18th century European facades. It has beautifully designed interiors,
              antique furniture, vast courtyards and rooms with colourful tiled walls and
               mosaic floors. There is also a Nizam’s museum with extensive collection, a
                library and Mukarram Jah Technical Institute inside the U shaped complex where
                 the haveli is located.
