        <h1><br>LUMBINI PARK</h1>
        <p1>Developed in 1994 by the Hyderabad Urban Development Authority,
             Lumbini Park has been named after birthplace of Lord Buddha.
              Located quite close to the Hussain Sagar Lake, it is one of
               the popular tourist spots of Hyderabad.

            The giant clock designed with varied kinds of captivating flowering
             plants, which you see at the entrance is one of the prime attractions
              of the park. The musical fountain and the laser show here mustn’t be missed.
               Another key feature of Lumbini Park is its rich flora. It is open from 9 am
