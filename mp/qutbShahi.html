        <h1><br>QUTUB SHAHI TOMBS</h1>
        <p1>Consisted of the tombs of 7 Qutub Shahi rulers, these are
             known to be one of the oldest heritage sites of Hyderabad.
              Qutub Shahi Tombs are located only at a distance of 850 m
               from the Banjara Darwaza of Golconda Fort.

            Presenting a combination of Persian and Indian architecture,
             these tombs were built by the Qutub Shahis. Later in 19th century,
              these were renovated by Salar Jung III, Mir Yousuf Ali Khan.
            
            Constructed with grey granite, these quadrangular structure with
             dome shape roofs are ornamented with beautiful designs. The garden
              ‘Ibrahim Bagh’ which surrounds the tombs is popular as picnic spots.
               These tombs are now also used a venue for Deccan festival by the state
                Government.
